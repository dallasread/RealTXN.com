At Instagive.io, we thrive on making your life easier - as a donor and as an organization. We're happy to announce, "We've done it again!"

#### We've done it again!

Your charity spends hours "administrating" donations every single week. Our early estimates indicate that it costs about $1 - $2 to process every transaction that comes in. Your process probably looks something like this:

<!-- more -->

1. Receive
2. Sort
3. Count
4. Double-check the Count
5. Record
6. Reconcile
7. Deposit

Sometimes, cheques bounce.

Sometimes, human-error happens.

Sometimes, the numbers just don't balance.

Sometimes, its time to issue the year's tax receipts.

Suddenly, all new problems & costs appear. Our early estimates indicate 3 - 5 minutes is spent per donor *just for tax receipting*:

1. Delivering & Mailing
2. Lost Receipts
3. Tax Audits

#### Instagive.io at work

When you receive donations through Instagive.io, your workload *disappears*. The week-to-week process now looks like this:

1. Receive directly to your account
2. Reconcile

Now, you can start doing *more valuable* things with your time - spending it on areas of your charity that really need it. Oh, by the way, the administrative costs becomes almost $0!

#### The Best News: (Our Newest Feature)

We've put a bunch of work into our automatic tax receipting feature. Every January 1, our system processes all the transactions made that year and generates a receipt for each donor. If the donor has made donations to various causes, they'll receive a breakdown of their giving. Then, we email that receipt to the donor.

When tax season rolls around, you won't have to lift a finger. Well, you may have to point a few people back to Instagive.io, where they can re-download their receipt (if they lost the email). The receipt looks a lot like this:

#### Can they use a receipt more than once?

Each receipt is marked with a TAX RECEIPT ID. This number remains the same per donor, per year, and links their receipt with their account. So, even if they print off a tax receipt in June 2015 for the 2012 tax year, it will still have the same TAX RECEIPT ID as it did when it was issued back in 2013.

#### How can I offer my donors automatic tax receipts?

If you have an account already, simply visit your "Settings" page and check the box that says "Yes, issue tax receipts on my behalf." If it's already checked, you're already ready to go! Once you save the form, you'll be redirected to a page to input your charity's address and its authorized officer (along with their signature).

If you don't have an Instagive.io account, you'll need to [set one up](https://instagive.io/organizations/new).
