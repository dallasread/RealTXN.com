The most difficult thing about running a small business (or your life) is deciding what to work on. With unlimited choices, it's overwhelmingly clear that **opportunity cost** owns the day.

> Opportunity Cost: what you lose by doing something **instead** of doing something else.

There's an infinite array of things to do. Accounting, payroll, marketing, invoicing, creditors, debtors, networking...

### Routines are a good night's sleep<!-- more -->

Humans are creatures of habit. We do the same things, day after day. We go to the same places, walk the same paths, sit in the same chairs, write the same words, and bump against the same problems.

Certainly, there's a ton of merit and value in routines. In the software world, no program worth its salt would ever be released without sufficient testing. Software test suites usually come in the form of hundreds of tests that run in an instant, letting the developer know if the code quality is up to par.

Routines ensure quality. They let you sleep at night knowing that all your bases are covered.

But there is a catch &mdash; **routines are harmful.**

Routines make you lazy. They turn your brain to mush. Auto-pilot. When you routine something, it means that someone else can do it faster, cheaper, and smarter than you. It means you're going to be out of business soon.

### What should I work on then?

If you want to really make an irreplaceable difference, spend your time doing things that cannot be routined. Create routines. Break routines. Shrink routines. Merge routines.

Routines happen to be the biggest Return On Investment for any company. Every time they're used, the initial investment skyrockets.

TLDR; Routines are vital, but *you* shouldn't be wasting your time doing them. Create routines, then outsource them to better tools or employees.
