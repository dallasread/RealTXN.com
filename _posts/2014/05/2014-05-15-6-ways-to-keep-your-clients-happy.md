### 1. Stay in touch
Let them know you're thinking of their best interest by sending them relevant articles, blog posts, or personal notes. These resources should be candid, personal, and useful to them.

Is their birthday coming up? Send them a personal greeting card! Is their home anniversary approaching? Send them a home evaluation kit!

### 2. Over-deliver
[In 4 brilliantly compiled words](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/05/four-words.html){:target="_blank"}, Seth Godin captures the essence of word-of-mouth marketing:

> Make big promises; overdeliver.

Of course, "big" is relative. An ordinary promise can be made irresistable with good positioning or change of perspective.

### 3. Connect them to someone else

Become the person your clients rely on to find referrals for absolutely anything - lawyers, doctors, schools, electricians, plumbers, etc. By connecting them with others, you'll become invaluable. And... guess who they're going to be talking about when they meet?

### 4. Give them something

People love receiving things. Its the quickest way to win someone over. They'll feel they must reciprocate and pay you with their attention. A birthday card, pen, key chain, or even [premium business cards](http://plasticbizcards.com) can do the trick. 

Seriously, I've had people try to give my business card back to me because they seemed "too expensive to be giving out."

### 5. Reply

There's a fascinating study done by Zendesk showing how customer happiness is directly proportional to speed of response. As your client's move into our digital age through Facebook and Twitter, this experience will likely become even more magnified.

### 6. Keep them in the loop

Let's pretend we're waiting for a train that's supposed to come every 15 minutes. We don't know when its coming, and there are no street signs letting us know when it would be there. Anxious yet?

Now, let's pretend we're waiting for a train, but there's a sign saying the train would be there in 15 minutes. Don't you feel more confident in waiting?

What changed?

In the second case, we had information.

Informed clients are happy clients. The more they know, the more comfortable they feel.
