    <div class="faqs">
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p class="question">How long before I can start taking donations?</p>
          <p class="answer">As soon as you sign up and input your information. Its that quick. The whole process takes about five minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">Is this method of giving secure? </p>
          <p class="answer">Security is one of our top priorities. We don’t store any sensitive data (credit card numbers, etc). We hand all of those concerns over to our payment processor, Stripe.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">What are the different types of payments you can process?</p>
          <p class="answer">All major credit cards including Visa, Mastercard, and American Express. We also accept Visa/Mastercard debit cards from banks such as TD, CIBC, RBC, and BMO.   </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">How will I know a donation has been made?</p>
          <p class="answer">An email confirmation will be sent to both the giver and the church. It will contain a receipt for the giver and a notification for the church. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">How soon does the transaction go into the churches account? </p>
          <p class="answer">You will be paid on a seven day rolling basis. E.g., you will receive funds for your March 1st charges on March 8th.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">What happens if there are insufficient funds?</p>
          <p class="answer">Transactions are validated in real time to ensure the funds are available. In the case of a failed recurring payment, the donor will receive a notification to update their card information. We'll try to process the transaction 2 more times over the next 2 days, then deactivate the card.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">Can I use Instagive for other transactions than tithes and offering?</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">Why do you charge fees on transactions?</p>
          <p class="answer">Instead of contracts, setup fees, or monthly plans, our rates are pay-as-you-grow. Instagive’s rate of only 3.9% + 60¢ per transaction is very competitive and allows us to keep offering you the best service possible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">What does the transaction look like in my donor's bank account?</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">How is your system any different than others?</p>
          <p class="answer">Our main focus is to help non profits and charities. We also offer a completely customizable app for your organizaiton. Not to mention that our system is already setup for one time and recurring payments.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="question">Do I have to be a charity to use Instagive.io?</p>
          <p class="answer">No! At this stage in our company, we've chosen to focus on signing up charities and non-profits, but we're more than happy to welcome companies and for-profits.</p>
